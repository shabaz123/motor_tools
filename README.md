# motor_tools

This repository contains MicroPython code for the Pi Pico, related to motor control and sensing.

## mps_motor.py
This code can be used to control MPS digital servo motors (ther Pico needs to be connected to an RS485 interface)

## stepper_drive.py
This code can be used to control any stepper motor connected to a driver board with PULSE and DIRECTION inputs (an example is Leadshine DM 556).

## ma732.py
This code can be used to read and communicate with MPS MA732 digital angle sensor chips.
